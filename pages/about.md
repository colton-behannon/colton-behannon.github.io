## About me

# Background

My background is in traditional data science but has pivoted to generative AI for the last two years. I am currently building cool applications utilizing the latest LLM breakthroughs.

# Hobbies

I enjoy playing video games (Overwatch, League of Legends, Stardew Valley), golf, and hanging out with my friends and family. Lately I have been rapidly consuming all of Brandon Sanderson's works in the Cosmere.
